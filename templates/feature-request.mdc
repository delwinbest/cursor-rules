## Feature Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting
- **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
- **Check project roadmap** to see if already planned
- **Consider the scope** - is this a single feature or multiple?
- **Think about edge cases** and error scenarios

### Feature vs Enhancement
- **New Feature**: Completely new functionality
- **Enhancement**: Improvement to existing functionality
- **Bug Fix**: Fixing broken functionality (use bug report template)

### Priority Guidelines
- **High**: Critical for project success, blocks other work
- **Medium**: Important but not blocking, fits project timeline
- **Low**: Nice to have, can be deferred

### Implementation Planning
1. **Create feature branch** from development: `feature/feature-name`
2. **Break down into tasks** if complex
3. **Implement incrementally** with frequent commits
4. **Test thoroughly** at each step
5. **Create PR** with comprehensive description

## Example Feature Request

### ðŸš€ Feature Description
Add drag and drop functionality to the kanban board to allow users to move cards between columns and reorder cards within columns.

### ðŸŽ¯ Problem/Use Case
Currently, users can only move cards by editing them and changing the column. This is inefficient for quick reorganization of tasks and doesn't provide the intuitive kanban experience users expect.

### ðŸ’¡ Proposed Solution
Implement HTML5 drag and drop API with visual feedback:
- Cards become draggable with cursor change
- Drop zones highlight when dragging over valid targets
- Smooth animations for card movement
- Keyboard accessibility for drag operations
- Optimistic updates with rollback on failure

### ðŸ”„ Alternative Solutions
- Add "Move to Column" dropdown in card edit modal
- Add keyboard shortcuts for moving cards
- Add bulk selection and move functionality

### ðŸ“‹ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cards can be dragged between columns
- [ ] Cards can be reordered within columns
- [ ] Visual feedback during drag operations
- [ ] Keyboard accessibility (Tab to select, Enter to move)
- [ ] Optimistic updates with error handling
- [ ] Works on mobile devices
- [ ] Maintains card state during move

### ðŸ§ª Testing Requirements
- Test drag and drop on desktop and mobile
- Test keyboard navigation and accessibility
- Test with multiple users simultaneously
- Test error scenarios (network failures, invalid moves)
- Test performance with large numbers of cards

### ðŸ“Š Impact Assessment
- **User Impact**: Significantly improves user experience and productivity
- **Development Effort**: Medium complexity, estimated 2-3 weeks
- **Breaking Changes**: None
- **Dependencies**: None

### ðŸŽ¨ Design Considerations
- **UI/UX**: Use subtle animations and clear visual feedback
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard support and screen reader compatibility
- **Mobile**: Touch-friendly drag interactions
- **Performance**: Efficient re-rendering during drag operations

### ðŸ“š Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Update README with drag and drop instructions
- [ ] Add accessibility documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation if needed

### ðŸ”— Related Information
- **Priority**: High
- **Related Issues**: #15, #23
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Timeline**: Q2 2024
